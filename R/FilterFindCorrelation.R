#' @description
#' Simple filter emulating `caret::findCorrelation(exact = FALSE)`.
#'
#' This gives each feature a score between 0 and 1 that is *one minus* the
#' cutoff value for which it is excluded when using [caret::findCorrelation()].
#' The negative is used because [caret::findCorrelation()] excludes everything
#' *above* a cutoff, while filters exclude everything below a cutoff.
#' Here the filter scores are shifted by +1 to get positive values for to align
#' with the way other filters work.
#'
#' Subsequently `caret::findCorrelation(cutoff = 0.9)` lists the same features
#' that are excluded with `FilterFindCorrelation` at score 0.1 (= 1 - 0.9).
